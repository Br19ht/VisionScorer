# VisionScorer

VisionScorer is a multi-object tracking pipeline designed for basketball games. This notebook enables you to detect and track players, the ball, and the hoop using a pre-trained YOLOv11 model with post-processing.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use

You don’t need to install anything locally! Just follow these steps to run the notebook in Google Colab:

1. **Download the notebook**  
   [Click here](https://github.com/Br19ht/VisionScorer/blob/main/Vision_Scorer_V2.5.ipynb) to download `Vision_Scorer_V2.5.ipynb` from GitHub.
   You can do this by clicking 3 dots on upper-right corner, and clicking on download.
   Or, simply press `ctrl + shift + s` (Windows) or `cmd + shift + s` (Mac)

3. **Open with Google Colab**  
   Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and upload the `.ipynb` file.
   You can do this by clicking on 'Upload' from the pop-up, and upload the downloaded `.ipynb` file from Step 1.

5. **Set runtime to T4 GPU**  
   - Click on `Runtime` > `Change runtime type`  
   - Set **Hardware accelerator** to **T4 GPU**  

6. **Run all cells**  
   - Click `Runtime` > `Run all`  
   - Let the pipeline do the rest!

## 📝 Notes

- All necessary models and dependencies are auto-installed in the notebook.
- This setup assumes no local configuration or environment setup is required.
- Runtime may vary based on the video file and input complexity, in case you are trying different inputs.
